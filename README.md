# Android app prototype for the Railtech Open innovation challenge

## Features of our app
### Sending requests
- Scanning of Wi-fi Access points in the area using WifiManager
- Sending all of that data to a server

## Updating UI
- A login page - To determine what name to send the POST request under, and to determine the name of the user that is displayed on the map
- Check-in page with scanning QR code functionality, redirecting user to a check-in confirmation page
- Home screen (Which has a map that will be updated whenever the POST request when sending WifiManager data to the server returns location data)
